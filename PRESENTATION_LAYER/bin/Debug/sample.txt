Needing a capable videographer to film a short testimonial (sit down interview style).<br />
You do not need to write a script or storyboard for this project, just show up to flim and edit footage into a short video.<br /><br />
(1 hour- 2 hours) Filming.<br />
Filming will be indoors at the University ofAuckland from 10am-11am this Friday 29th January, a discreet mic will be required to pick up audio. The whole filming time should take no more than 2 hours including set up, filming and pack down - we&#039;re only asking the researcher a couple of questions.<br /><br />
(1 hour - 2 hours) Post Production.<br />
Footage and audio will need to be synced, and editing will include an opening and end screen (logos and branding materials provided), plus cutting to the researcher&#039;s responses while the question is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The entire video will be less than 5 mins.<br /><br />
An example of the type of video I need will be provided if you are chosen for this project.<br /><br />
Things that would make you be considered for other jobs:<br />
- high quality resolution images<br />
- seamless transitions<br />
- ease of communication<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $12.00-$40.00

I believe the pervious programmer used existing off-the-shelf methods/modules to create this program.<br />
The program imports a pdf image file from a user selected folder and/or desktop scanner input, and stores the image with user supplied data with the image. The data is stored in a simple folder based structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The program allows the copying and pasting of data, viewing of the stored image, backup functions, a summary report of the data, and ability to change the theme colors.<br />
Freelancer will have access to the finished installer program, as well as the source code of the original product, plus a list of bug fixes and changes needed to the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix what&#039;s there, or start from scratch, your choice.<br />
Finished product shall be totally owned by the client, and must use free licensed modules where needed. Finished product should need password to operate after 30 days.<br />
Anything else, you&#039;ll need to ask me.<br />
Thanks.<br /><br />
Here is the original job posting:<br /><br />
I am in need of a programmer for the following project to run on x86 or x64 standard PC platform:<br /><br />
This is a simple receipt organizing system. A PC user will use a standard scanner to import an image, and enter a few fields of data that are tied to this image.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can store the records in various software-internal folders. The user will be able to print out a summary report based upon the records in a folder.<br /><br />
Each database record will have eight fields. One of the fields will be a date, one will be a number, two will be text, two will be a check box, and one will be an image.<br />
The records will be stored in folders with a standard hierarchy format.<br />
The system must print out a summary report and send to a printer. There will be only one summary report, and it will summarize groups of data based upon one of the fields of the records.<br /><br />
The DBMS/UI will be as follows:<br />
25% of the screen interface must show images of user-created folders for organizing the records.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user should be able to create folders and subfolders and have general control over them, such as naming them and moving them around.<br />
25% of the screen will show the image field of the currently displayed record.<br />
50% of the screen will show a list of records in the selected folder. In this list, the remaining 7 fields are displayed on a line, which will make columns of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the columns, the columns will have a set description, such as &#039;Date&#039;, &#039;Amount&#039;, etc. The user will be able to click on a column header to sort the folder&#039;s records in ascending or descending order.<br />
The user will be able to modify the field contents of a record in this display. One of the fields will have a drop down box of about ten text records to choose from.<br />
The user will be able to delete, create, copy, and move a record.<br />
Highlighting a record will show the corresponding image in the appropriate section of the screen. If possible, a means to zoom into the image and scroll the image will be included, OR, a button will be implemented to have the image exported into external software for detailed viewing.<br />
The user will import scans of an image using standard TWAIN, and also be able to import an image by &#039;printing to&#039; the software.<br />
The user will be able to create a summary report of the record contents of a folder and send it to a printer.<br /><br /><br />
If you have any questions, please let me know.<br /><br />
Any responses to this inquiry should provide a general outline of the time and funds expected to complete this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don&#039;t know how much is involved, and you do, which is why I&#039;m posting this job.<br /><br />

]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am in need of a recreation of a custom database program I had made a couple of years ago by another freelancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are unable to fix the bugs in this software, therefore I need it re-created.<br />
I believe the pervious programmer used existing off-the-shelf methods/modules to create this program.<br />
The program imports a pdf image file from a user selected folder and/or desktop scanner input, and stores the image with user supplied data with the image. The data is stored in a simple folder based structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The program allows the copying and pasting of data, viewing of the stored image, backup functions, a summary report of the data, and ability to change the theme colors.<br />
Freelancer will have access to the finished installer program, as well as the source code of the original product, plus a list of bug fixes and changes needed to the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix what&#039;s there, or start from scratch, your choice.<br />
Finished product shall be totally owned by the client, and must use free licensed modules where needed. Finished product should need password to operate after 30 days.<br />
Anything else, you&#039;ll need to ask me.<br />
Thanks.<br /><br />
Here is the original job posting:<br /><br />
I am in need of a programmer for the following project to run on x86 or x64 standard PC platform:<br /><br />
This is a simple receipt organizing system. A PC user will use a standard scanner to import an image, and enter a few fields of data that are tied to this image.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can store the records in various software-internal folders. The user will be able to print out a summary report based upon the records in a folder.<br /><br />
Each database record will have eight fields. One of the fields will be a date, one will be a number, two will be text, two will be a check box, and one will be an image.<br />
The records will be stored in folders with a standard hierarchy format.<br />
The system must print out a summary report and send to a printer. There will be only one summary report, and it will summarize groups of data based upon one of the fields of the records.<br /><br />
The DBMS/UI will be as follows:<br />
25% of the screen interface must show images of user-created folders for organizing the records.&nbsp;&nbsp;The user should be able to create folders and subfolders and have general control over them, such as naming them and moving them around.<br />
25% of the screen will show the image field of the currently displayed record.<br />
50% of the screen will show a list of records in the selected folder. In this list, the remaining 7 fields are displayed on a line, which will make columns of data.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the columns, the columns will have a set description, such as &#039;Date&#039;, &#039;Amount&#039;, etc. The user will be able to click on a column header to sort the folder&#039;s records in ascending or descending order.<br />
The user will be able to modify the field contents of a record in this display. One of the fields will have a drop down box of about ten text records to choose from.<br />
The user will be able to delete, create, copy, and move a record.<br />
Highlighting a record will show the corresponding image in the appropriate section of the screen. If possible, a means to zoom into the image and scroll the image will be included, OR, a button will be implemented to have the image exported into external software for detailed viewing.<br />
The user will import scans of an image using standard TWAIN, and also be able to import an image by &#039;printing to&#039; the software.<br />
The user will be able to create a summary report of the record contents of a folder and send it to a printer.<br /><br /><br />
If you have any questions, please let me know.<br /><br />
Any responses to this inquiry should provide a general outline of the time and funds expected to complete this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don&#039;t know how much is involved, and you do, which is why I&#039;m posting this job.<br /><br />
